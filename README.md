# FSVNet
FSVNet is a deep learning-based signal detection and image classification method that provides an effective tool for ultra-sensitive and even single-atom detection. By constructing a multi-layer deep convolutional neural network model FSVNet, the hidden features and signal information of the FSV voltammetry diagram are extracted. Experiments show that the signal recognition and classification accuracy of the positive signal and blank cathode signal of single atom Cu2+ is more than 99%.
